# Object Detection (GeneralizedRCNN)

A two-stage object detector is the canonical case for a [meta model](meta_models.md). A
torchvision Faster R-CNN (`torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`, an FPN backbone +
RPN + RoIHeads GeneralizedRCNN) is mostly dense tensor math, but the middle of the pipeline is not:
selecting RPN proposals, running NMS, pooling ROI features with `roi_align`, decoding boxes, and the
final per-class NMS are all data-dependent and cannot be captured by `torch.export` as a single
static graph. The shape of the work changes with the contents of the tensors, which is exactly what a
static StableHLO program cannot express.

The package ships a converter that handles this split for you. It produces two dense StableHLO
bundles for the parts that trace cleanly and a meta bundle whose `model.jl` runs the data-dependent
glue in Julia between them. The reusable detection math (NMS, `roi_align`, box decode, anchor
generation) lives in the `ReactantServer.DetectionGlue` module and is already part of the package, so
the generated `model.jl` is small and the conversion is config-driven.

This page walks through converting a standard torchvision detector end to end. For the underlying
execution model (the meta gate, committed sub-calls, placement) see [Meta Models](meta_models.md).

## The shape of the conversion

One source model is emitted as three bundles under the output root:

| Bundle | Contents | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<name>_stage1` | Backbone + RPN head | StableHLO |
| `<name>_stage2` | Box head + box predictor over a fixed number of ROIs | StableHLO |
| `<name>` | Chains stage1 → `DetectionGlue` → stage2 → final NMS | `meta` |

`stage1` takes the preprocessed image and returns 14 dense tensors: the four ROI-pooling feature maps
(`feat_0`–`feat_3`), the five per-level objectness maps (`obj_0`–`obj_4`), and the five per-level box
deltas (`delta_0`–`delta_4`). `stage2` takes ROI-pooled features for a fixed `K` proposals
(`[K, 256, 7, 7]` in torch, `(7, 7, 256, K)` in the Julia column-major wire layout) and returns
`cls_logits` (`[K, num_classes]`) and `bbox_deltas` (`[K, num_classes*4]`). The meta bundle owns no
weights of its own; it is placed as a group with its two stages and routed by the gateway as a single
unit (see the placement section of [Meta Models](meta_models.md)).

Only `<name>` is addressable by clients. The two stages are internal to the meta and never appear in
the gateway's routing table.

Crucially, both stages are plain `nn.Module`s that `torch.export` traces directly: the converter
builds the torchvision model, wraps `backbone` + `rpn.head` and `box_head` + `box_predictor`, and
exports them. There is no `torch.jit` load and no reaching into a scripted graph's frozen internals.

## Running the converter

The converter is `tools/convert_to_stablehlo.jl`, driven by a YAML config. The torchvision
detector is a *handler* (a special-case builder), shipped at
`tools/handlers/torchvision_frcnn_detector.jl`. Reference it from the `handlers:` block of your
config, keyed by a model name:

```yaml
output_root: /docker/reactantserver/models

handlers:
  - file: handlers/torchvision_frcnn_detector.jl
    models: [my_detector]
    options:
      weights: DEFAULT      # DEFAULT = pretrained COCO; "none" = random; or a path to a state_dict .pth
      num_classes: 91       # classes INCLUDING background; set when loading a custom head
      image_size: 640       # canonical square input edge, divisible by 64
      input_dtype: u8       # client image dtype (u8 | f32)
      output_cols: 6        # 5 = [box4, score]; 6 = [box4, score, class]
```

Relative paths (including `file:` and any option key ending in `_dir`/`_path`) resolve against the
config file's directory. With `weights: DEFAULT` the converter builds the pretrained COCO model, so
no source artifact is needed (the runnable demo path); to convert your own trained detector, point
`weights` at a saved `state_dict` and set `num_classes` to match its head. A handler runs after the
torch/torchax/triton imports, so it may freely call `pyexec`/`pyimport`.

Run it from the repository root, instantiating against an environment that has torch, torchvision,
torchax, and `ReactantServerExport`:

```
julia tools/convert_to_stablehlo.jl <config>.yaml --only my_detector
```

Use `--dry-run` to validate the config and handler load without paying torch startup, and `--force`
to rebuild a bundle that already exists. The run emits `my_detector_stage1`,
`my_detector_stage2`, and the `my_detector` meta bundle.

## The generated meta `model.jl`

The handler bakes the per-model config it reads from the live model (the per-level `cell_anchors`,
the RPN/ROI box-coder weights, the RPN pre-NMS top-k and NMS threshold, and the final
`score`/`nms`/`detections_per_img`) into the meta bundle's `model.jl`, then registers the
orchestration with [`register_meta_model`](@ref). The emitted function, lightly abridged, is:

```julia
const _G = ReactantServer.DetectionGlue

function _run(inputs, call)
    iw = size(inputs[1].data, 1); ih = size(inputs[1].data, 2)

    # Stage 1: backbone + RPN head. 14 dense outputs.
    s1 = call("my_detector_stage1", inputs)
    d  = Dict(t.name => t.data for t in s1)

    # Per-level: generate anchors, decode RPN deltas to boxes, flatten objectness.
    bl = Matrix{Float64}[]; sl = Vector{Float64}[]
    for i in 1:5
        O = d[_OBJ[i]]; D = d[_DEL[i]]
        anc = _G.generate_anchors(size(O, 2), size(O, 1), _STR[i], _CELL[i])
        push!(bl, _G.decode_boxes(_G.deltas_matrix(D), anc, _RPNW))
        push!(sl, _G.objectness_flat(O))
    end

    # Select the top-K proposals (NMS across levels), then ROIAlign the feature maps. torchvision's
    # detection pooler is aligned=false with sampling_ratio=2.
    pb = _G.select_rpn_proposals(bl, sl, ih, iw; pre=_PRE, post=_K, nms_thresh=_RPNNMS); Kp = size(pb, 1)
    feats = [_G.feature_chw(d[f]) for f in _FEAT]
    roi = call.scratch((7, 7, 256, _K), Float32); fill!(roi, 0f0)   # reuse buffer; passed by reference
    lv = [_G.assign_level(@view pb[k, :]) for k in 1:Kp]
    for l in 0:3
        sel = findall(==(l), lv); isempty(sel) && continue
        _G.roi_align_wire!(view(roi, :, :, :, sel), feats[l+1], pb[sel, :], _SCALES[l+1];
                           ratio=2, aligned=false)
    end

    # Stage 2: box head + predictor on the pooled ROIs, then the final per-class NMS. torchvision's
    # FastRCNNPredictor places background at class 0, so bg_first=true.
    s2 = call("my_detector_stage2", [ReactantServer.NamedTensor("ROI_FEATS", roi)])
    d2 = Dict(t.name => t.data for t in s2)
    cls = permutedims(d2["cls_logits"], (2, 1))[1:Kp, :]
    dl  = permutedims(d2["bbox_deltas"], (2, 1))[1:Kp, :]
    bx, sc, cl = _G.fast_rcnn_inference(cls, dl, pb, ih, iw;
        score_thresh=_SCORE, nms_thresh=_NMS, topk=_TOPK, weights=_ROIW, bg_first=true, min_size=1e-2)

    return [ReactantServer.NamedTensor("OUTPUT__0", assemble(bx, sc, cl))]
end

register_meta_model("my_detector"; run = _run)
```

Every data-dependent step is a plain function in `ReactantServer.DetectionGlue`:
`generate_anchors`, `decode_boxes`, `select_rpn_proposals`, `roi_align_wire!`, `assign_level`, and
`fast_rcnn_inference`. A few `DetectionGlue` knobs select the torchvision conventions:
`roi_align_wire!(...; aligned=false)` uses torchvision's ROIAlign offset and malformed-ROI clamp, and
`fast_rcnn_inference(...; bg_first=true, min_size=1e-2)` treats class 0 as background and drops
sub-pixel final boxes the way torchvision's `postprocess_detections` does. The
ROI feature tensor is the large intermediate handed between stages, so it is allocated from the
worker's reuse pool with `call.scratch`; in a fleet that buffer is backed by a shared-memory slot so
the sub-call sends it by reference instead of serializing it (see the `call.scratch` section of
[Meta Models](meta_models.md)).

## Options and assumptions

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `weights` | `DEFAULT` | `DEFAULT` builds the pretrained COCO model; `none` is random (structure only); a path loads a `state_dict` `.pth`. |
| `num_classes` | `91` | Classes including background; set this when loading a custom head. |
| `image_size` | `640` | Canonical square input edge, divisible by 64 (FPN p6/pool stride). |
| `input_dtype` | `u8` | Client image dtype: `u8` (divided by 255 then normalized) or `f32` (assumed already in `[0,1]`). |
| `output_cols` | `6` | Per-detection width: `5` = `[box4, score]`, `6` = `[box4, score, class]`. |
| `input_shapes` | — | Optional list of `[W, H]` pairs to compile stage1 for several aspect ratios sharing one weight set (each edge divisible by 64). |

Two assumptions are worth calling out:

- **Input is a batched RGB image.** The client sends an NCHW image (`[1, 3, H, W]`) at the compiled
  size; stage1 bakes the ImageNet normalization (and the `/255` for `u8`) so the client sends a raw
  image. The served wrapper letterboxes to one of the compiled `image_size`/`input_shapes`; the model
  is not resized at run time.
- **Class ids follow torchvision.** With `output_cols: 6` the emitted class is the torchvision label
  (`1..num_classes-1`); background (class 0) is dropped.
