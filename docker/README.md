# Docker deployment

One container runs the whole node. The image's default entrypoint is the supervisor
(`ReactantServerNode`): it detects every GPU granted to the container, spawns one single-GPU
worker subprocess per device, runs the embedded gateway, multiplexes all logs onto the
container's stdout with `[worker0]` / `[gateway]` line prefixes, and restarts children that die.

```
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 \
  -v /path/to/bundles:/var/lib/reactantserver/models:ro reactantserver
```

Clients connect to the KServe V2 gRPC endpoint on `localhost:8001`; health and metrics are on
`localhost:8002` (`/readyz`, `/healthz`, `/metrics`), matching Triton's ports. Adding a GPU to
the host changes nothing in the configuration: the supervisor sees one more device and spawns
one more worker.

## Files

- `Dockerfile.worker` — the unified `reactantserver` image (`julia:1.12.5-trixie`). Copies the
  whole `packages/` tree and builds the workspace root (so the shared `Manifest.toml` pins the
  HTTP/Reactant forks). Default entrypoint is the supervisor; `entrypoint.worker.sh` remains in
  the image as the single-worker escape hatch.
- `Dockerfile.gateway` — slim, pure-Julia gateway-only image for multi-node gateway hosts.
  Built from the `ReactantServerGateway` member alone, so the image pulls **no Reactant**.
- `entrypoint.node.sh` — launches `ReactantServerNode.main()` (the supervisor).
- `entrypoint.worker.sh` — launches a single `ReactantServer.serve` worker named by
  `REACTANT_WORKER_NAME` (used by the per-GPU-container layouts, e.g. the e2e and soak stacks).
- `entrypoint.gateway.sh` — launches `ReactantServerGateway.serve_gateway` against a mounted
  gateway.yml (the standalone gateway image).
- `healthcheck.node.sh` — role-aware container healthcheck: curls the gateway's `/readyz` in the
  `all`/`gateway` roles, falls back to the Julia worker probe in the `workers` role.
- `healthcheck.worker.jl` — lightweight Julia readiness probe (imports only gRPCClient and
  YAML). With `REACTANT_WORKER_NAME` set it probes that worker; unset, it probes every worker in
  the node file and passes when at least one is ready.
- `node.default.yaml` — the zero-config node file baked into the image at
  `/etc/reactantserver/node.yaml` (`gpus: auto`, no workers list).
- `node.yaml` — the fully commented node-file template to mount over the baked default.
- `gateway.yml` — gateway config for standalone (multi-node) gateways: listen addresses plus a
  static worker endpoint list. The embedded gateway needs no file; the supervisor synthesizes
  its endpoints.
- `../docker-compose.yml` — the single-service stack (equivalent to the `docker run` above).
- `../docker-compose.multinode.yml` — reference for multi-node: a `workers`-role node service
  plus a standalone gateway service.

## Prerequisites

1. Populate the vendored submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
   This fetches `lib/Reactant.jl`, `lib/gRPCServer.jl`, `lib/gRPCClient.jl`, and `lib/HTTP.jl`.
2. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host (for GPU access).
3. Have a model bundle repository on the host. Each immediate subdirectory with a
   `manifest.yaml` is a bundle; its directory name is the model name.

## Build and run

```
make image        # or: docker compose build
REACTANTSERVER_MODELS=/path/to/bundles docker compose up
```

Every model compiles (Reactant -> device executable) before the gRPC plane accepts traffic, so
first startup is slow and the image healthcheck's `start_period` is generous (300s); raise it
for large model sets. Logs from all workers and the gateway appear on the container's stdout,
one line each, prefixed `[worker0]`, `[worker1]`, ..., `[gateway]`, `[supervisor]`.

## Configuring

Zero configuration is the default: the baked node file sets `gpus: auto` and the supervisor
synthesizes `worker0..workerN-1`, one per detected device. To customize, mount a node file over
`/etc/reactantserver/node.yaml` (see `node.yaml` for the commented template):

- `gpus:` — `auto` (default), an integer count, or an explicit device list (ordinals or GPU
  UUIDs). The `REACTANT_GPUS` environment variable overrides this key.
- `workers:` — optional. When present it wins over auto-detection: device i goes to worker i
  (or a worker's `gpu:` key picks a specific visible device). Per-worker config override blocks
  merge over `global:` as before.
- `models:` — optional per-model pinning to device memory on named workers.
- `global:` — defaults merged into every worker (runtime, scheduler, cache_dir, endpoints).

Supervisor environment variables: `REACTANT_GPUS` (count or device list; `0` for a CPU node),
`REACTANT_CPU_WORKERS` (workers on a CPU node, default 1), `REACTANT_ROLE` (below),
`REACTANT_SUPERVISOR_MAX_RESTARTS` (consecutive crash budget per child before the node exits 1;
default unlimited, with the healthcheck reporting unready instead), `REACTANT_NODE_FILE`, and
`REACTANT_GATEWAY_FILE`.

The supervisor writes the materialized node file (with the synthesized workers list) to
`/run/reactantserver/node.yaml` for inspection; children and the healthcheck read that file.

## Roles (multi-node)

`REACTANT_ROLE` selects what runs in the container:

- `all` (default) — workers plus the embedded gateway. Publish 8001/8002; worker ports stay
  internal unless you also publish them (e.g. for direct Prometheus scrapes). Single-host
  deployments need nothing else.
- `workers` — workers only: for GPU nodes behind a remote gateway. Publish the per-worker port
  ranges (`base_port`+i, `metrics_base_port`+i).
- `gateway` — the gateway only. Mount a `gateway.yml` whose `endpoints:` lists every worker
  across all nodes (or set `REACTANT_GATEWAY_WORKERS=host:port,host:port,...`). The slim
  `reactantserver-gateway` image is equivalent and smaller.

See `../docker-compose.multinode.yml` for the reference topology. The KServe system
shared-memory data plane assumes client and worker share a host; multi-node clients use the
inline tensor path.

## Metrics

One scrape covers everything: the gateway's `/metrics` on the admin port (`8002`) serves its own
`gateway_*` series and, in the supervised all-in-one container, also fans out to every worker's
metrics endpoint and merges the results into a single exposition. Each worker tags all of its
series (`worker_*` plus `process_*`/`julia_gc_*`) with `worker` and `gpu` labels itself, where
`gpu` is the physical device behind the worker's `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, so nothing needs to be
configured in Prometheus:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: reactantserver
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node:8002']
```

Per-GPU and per-worker views fall out of the labels, e.g.
`sum by (gpu) (rate(worker_dispatch_total[1m]))` or
`worker_queue_wait_seconds{worker="worker1",quantile="0.99"}`. Per-endpoint scrape health is
reported as `gateway_worker_metrics_up{endpoint=...}`.

Worker metrics include per-model dispatch count, GPU compute seconds, queue depth and wait
quantiles, weight-cache load/evict churn, and device memory. Each worker still serves its own
`/metrics`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` on `metrics_base_port + i` (`worker0` → `9100`, …); publish
that range (`-p 9100-9107:9100-9107`) only if you also want to scrape workers directly. For a
standalone (multi-node) gateway, list the workers' metrics addresses under `metrics_endpoints:`
in gateway.yml (or `REACTANT_GATEWAY_WORKER_METRICS=host:port,...`) to get the same aggregated
scrape; the supervisor wires this automatically for the embedded gateway.

## Gateway scheduling

The gateway's `scheduling:` block (gateway.yml, or `REACTANT_GATEWAY_SCHEDULING_*` env for the
embedded gateway) selects how requests spread across workers. `round_robin` (default) rotates
each model's requests uniformly over its replicas. `lpt_packing` concentrates each model's
traffic on as few GPUs as the load allows, computed from the measured arrival rate and the
workers' reported compute cost, so the workers' batch coalescing sees deep same-model queues;
placement is rebalanced periodically with hysteresis and is observable via
`gateway_placement_weight{model,worker}`. It requires `scheduler.discipline: fifo` in the node
file and all models loaded on all workers (the load-all default); the gateway refuses to start
otherwise. See the `scheduling:` block in `docker/gateway.yml` for the knobs (or set
`REACTANT_GATEWAY_SCHEDULING_*` for the embedded gateway).

The FIFO requirement is by design, not a limitation: under lpt_packing the gateway is the single
fairness authority (concentration plus the per-worker share cap), so a worker-level fair
scheduler would fight the placement by throttling exactly the models the gateway concentrated
for batching. Keep the worker `fair` discipline for deployments without an upstream placement
authority: a single-GPU worker, or a multi-GPU fleet served round-robin.

## Single-GPU soak test

`docker-compose.gpu2.yml` brings up the supervised all-in-one container on one GPU to exercise
inference with dummy data and watch for memory leaks, races, and instability: the supervisor
runs one worker on GPU 2 (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2`) plus the embedded gateway, exactly as a
production single-GPU deployment does, alongside a `loadgen` service that drives sustained
concurrent requests. It uses on-demand weight caching so every bundle need not be GPU-resident
at once.

Files:

- `Dockerfile.loadgen` / `entrypoint.loadgen.sh` / `loadgen/loadgen.jl` — a light, Reactant-free
  load generator built from `ReactantServerClient`. It reads each manifest (`manifest_io_spec`)
  to synthesize correctly shaped zero inputs, then fires concurrent inferences at the gateway.
- `monitor_gpu2.sh` — host-side CSV logger (nvidia-smi for GPU 2 plus docker stats for the
  container) for leak detection; GPU memory and container RSS should plateau, not climb.

Prerequisites: built images (`make image loadgen`), checked-out submodules, and the
NVIDIA container runtime configured for Docker
(`sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker`).

Run:

```
REACTANTSERVER_MODELS=/path/to/bundles docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu2.yml up -d
docker/monitor_gpu2.sh &          # optional: log GPU/RSS to soak_monitor.csv
docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu2.yml down
```

The worker compiles and warms up every model's executables before it serves, so first startup is
slow (potentially hours for all 85 bundles). The worker healthcheck `start_period` is set high
to cover this. For a quick check, set `LOADGEN_MODELS` to a couple of bundle names in the
compose file and mount only those bundles.

Load parameters are the `loadgen` service's `LOADGEN_*` environment variables:
`LOADGEN_TRANSPORT` (`tcp`, `shm`, or `mixed`; `shm` exercises shared-memory
register/unregister), `LOADGEN_CONCURRENCY`, `LOADGEN_DURATION_SECONDS`,
`LOADGEN_REPORT_SECONDS`, and `LOADGEN_MODELS`. The generator's weight cache budget is
`WEIGHT_CACHE_BYTES` (default 24 GiB). The loadgen prints rolling throughput, latency, error
counts, and scraped gateway metrics, and exits nonzero if any request errored.
