    ResidencyState

The residency floor an operator (self-managed) or control plane (externally-managed) sets for a
model's weights. `UNPINNED` keeps no guaranteed residency (loaded from the mmap on demand);
`PINNED_SYSTEM` guarantees the weights stay resident in host RAM (and must be transferred to the
device before execution); `PINNED_DEVICE` guarantees them resident on the GPU for the server's
lifetime (exempt from eviction).
"""
@enum ResidencyState UNPINNED PINNED_SYSTEM PINNED_DEVICE

"""
    ResidencyMode

Who owns device residency on a worker, fixed at startup. `SELF_MANAGED` lets the worker
autonomously transfer and evict weights above each model's floor within the device budget;
`EXTERNALLY_MANAGED` makes a control plane authoritative (no autonomous eviction, non-resident
models are not served until pinned). This is no longer configured directly: it is derived from
[`ModelControlMode`](@ref) (`explicit` ⇒ `EXTERNALLY_MANAGED`, otherwise `SELF_MANAGED`).
"""
@enum ResidencyMode SELF_MANAGED EXTERNALLY_MANAGED

"""
    ModelControlMode

How a worker manages the set of loaded models over its lifetime (mirrors NVIDIA Triton's
model-control-mode). `STATIC` loads and compiles every bundle once at startup and never changes
the set. `DYNAMIC` (the default) additionally runs a filesystem watcher that polls the model
repository every `model_poll_seconds` and hot-swaps bundles as they are added, changed, or
removed on disk. `EXPLICIT` cedes authority to an upstream control plane (the externally-managed
residency behavior): no autonomous watcher, and non-resident models are not served until the
control plane pins them.
"""
@enum ModelControlMode STATIC DYNAMIC EXPLICIT

"""
    SchedulingDiscipline

The inter-model dispatch ordering. `FAIR` is the deficit-weighted, cost-aware policy with
per-model weights and the coalescing discount; `FIFO` serves in global arrival order; `EDF`
(earliest-deadline-first) serves the model whose most-urgent queued request has the soonest
deadline. Coalescing runs underneath all three.

Guidance: `FAIR` is for deployments where models share this worker with no upstream placement
authority, a single-GPU worker or a multi-GPU fleet behind the round-robin gateway, where the
worker itself must stop one model from crowding out the rest. Under the gateway's `lpt_packing`
scheduling the gateway is the fairness authority (placement concentration plus the per-worker
share cap), and workers must run `FIFO` or `EDF` so the two do not fight; `lpt_packing` supersedes
the role `FAIR` played on manually-assigned multi-GPU fleets.

`EDF` is for deadline-sensitive deployments where requests carry a remaining-budget timeout (see
the request-level timeout parameter). It degrades to `FIFO` whenever queued requests share the
same deadline, so its only divergence from `FIFO` is to promote requests with less budget left,
in practice the in-flight meta-model sub-calls that have already spent part of their budget on an
earlier stage. It also sheds work that cannot finish within its learned compute cost (laxity), so
it trades some throughput (batch fragmentation, and no per-model fairness) for hitting more
deadlines under load. NOTE: `EDF` derives urgency purely from the deadline, so issuing different
per-client deadlines for the same model reorders that model's service and therefore affects
fairness across clients; uniform deadlines keep it behaving like `FIFO`.
"""
@enum SchedulingDiscipline FAIR FIFO EDF

"""
    RuntimeConfig

Runtime and device settings (the `runtime:` config block). `backend` selects CPU or CUDA
execution; `device_ordinal` picks the GPU among several visible ones; `mem_fraction` is the
fraction of device memory claimed for the pool; `preallocate` claims that pool up front;
`allow_cpu_fallback` permits falling back to CPU when the device is unavailable;
`weight_cache_bytes` is the GPU byte budget for on-demand (unpinned) weights (`0` keeps every
model's weights resident, the original behavior); `residency_mode` selects self-managed or
externally-managed residency; `shared_host_weights` opts the node into the shared-memory
host-weight store so same-node workers share one host copy of each system-pinned model; and
`shared_host_weights_mode` sets the permission bits (an octal string, default `"666"`) for
those shared regions and their lock files. The `"666"` default keeps cross-UID container
setups working but is world-writable; `"660"` is recommended for production and multi-user
systems.
