# Concurrency-safe staging buffer with a fixed-slot allocator.
#
# A BufferPool is a single backing region (POSIX shared memory or a plain Memory{UInt8})
# divided into `n_slots` equal, non-overlapping slots of `slot_bytes` each. Slot index i maps
# to offset (i-1)*slot_bytes, so adjacent indices are physically contiguous and a caller can
# acquire a run of `span` slots as one contiguous byte range. Free slots are tracked in a
# bitmask guarded by a lock; `acquire_slot!` blocks until a contiguous run of the requested
# span is free and hands out a disjoint byte range; `release_slot!` returns the whole run.
# Concurrent producers can never be handed overlapping ranges, which is the property the old
# fixed-index/lockstep scheme only guaranteed within a single top-level inference call. The
# allocator also supplies natural back-pressure: a caller blocks when all slots are in flight
# instead of overrunning the buffer.
#
# Waiters are served strictly FIFO: only the head of `waitq` may allocate, and everyone else
# re-parks. Head-of-line blocking is deliberate — it guarantees a large-span waiter cannot be
# starved by a stream of span-1 acquisitions (a bypass scheme can livelock the large waiter
# forever through fragmentation), and it preserves the FIFO order span-1 callers had under the
# previous Channel-based free list.

`deadline_ns` is an absolute `time_ns()` deadline (0 = wait indefinitely, the default and prior
behavior). When set, a waiter that has not acquired by the deadline throws [`PoolAcquireTimeout`]
instead of parking past it. A one-shot timer wakes the waiter at the deadline even if no slot is
released in the meantime, so a starved waiter fails fast rather than burning a request's whole
