# Node configuration: a single file describing one machine (a single shared IPC space).
#
# A node is one physical machine with a single shared POSIX IPC space; `node.yaml` is the source
# of truth for the workers running on it. Every worker on the node reads the same file and
# resolves its own per-worker `ServerConfig` by name: global settings are merged with the
# worker's overrides, the model repository is shared, the listen port is derived from a base
# port, the device ordinal comes from the worker's GPU, and the node-level `shared_host_weights`
# flag is propagated. Every worker loads (and can serve) every bundle in the repo; the optional
# top-level `models:` map is a per-model override that pins the named models to device memory on
# the listed workers (translated into `scheduler.models.<name>.residency: device`).
#
# The resolved per-worker raw dict has exactly the shape `build_config` expects, so it flows
# through the same `apply_env_overrides!` -> `build_config` -> `validate_config` pipeline used
# for any server config. The node format is the only supported worker config file format. The
# gateway is configured separately (see ReactantServerGateway's gateway.yml).

# Worker-entry keys with structural meaning; any other key is treated as a config override
# block (e.g. `runtime`, `scheduler`) that is deep-merged over `global`.

With no `workers:` list, one is synthesized: `worker0..workerN-1`, one per device (or
`cpu_workers` workers when `devices` is empty). An explicit `workers:` list wins: each worker is
assigned `devices[i]` positionally, or `devices[gpu+1]` when the entry carries a `gpu:` key. The
`gpu:` key is consumed here (deleted after assignment) so each child process, seeing a single
device through `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, resolves device ordinal 0. Assigning one device to two
workers, or having more workers than devices, is a `ConfigError`. Call `validate_node` on the
result before use.
