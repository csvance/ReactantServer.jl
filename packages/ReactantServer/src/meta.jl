# Meta-model execution: a meta model is a user-authored Julia workflow (a bundle's model.jl that
# calls register_meta_model) that chains several models with data-dependent logic in between. Its
# orchestration runs on the gRPC request task (off the GPU dispatch loop, exactly like the
# pre/post hooks), and issues ordinary inference calls through an injected ModelCaller. The caller
# abstracts the destination: in single-worker mode it calls the local scheduler in-process; in
# multi-worker mode it calls back into the gateway over gRPC, so a backbone on another worker is
# reached transparently. The scheduler, dispatch loop, and weight cache never see meta models.

# Environment variable naming the loopback gRPC endpoint (the gateway in multi-worker mode). When
# unset, the worker has no gateway and meta sub-calls go in-process through the local scheduler.

  1. Deadlock-freedom: a request only ever holds one block, so it never waits on the pool while
     holding a slot — there is no acquire-while-holding circular wait.
  2. Allocation efficiency: one call carves N buffers from ONE block (waste = the unused tail of the
     final slot, < slot_bytes, O(1) in N); N separate calls would grab N blocks (O(n) waste).
A second call throws — enforced in both modes so the anti-pattern surfaces in single-worker testing,
not just under multi-worker load.
