# Meta-model execution: a meta model is a user-authored Julia workflow (a bundle's model.jl that
# calls register_meta_model) that chains several models with data-dependent logic in between. Its
# orchestration runs on the gRPC request task (off the GPU dispatch loop, exactly like the
# pre/post hooks), and issues ordinary inference calls through an injected ModelCaller. The caller
# abstracts the destination: in single-worker mode it calls the local scheduler in-process; in
# multi-worker mode it calls back into the gateway over gRPC, so a backbone on another worker is
# reached transparently. The scheduler, dispatch loop, and weight cache never see meta models.

# Environment variable naming the loopback gRPC endpoint (the gateway in multi-worker mode). When
# unset, the worker has no gateway and meta sub-calls go in-process through the local scheduler.
