# Model registry and the register_model extension API used by a bundle's model.jl.
#
# A ModelEntry is the single per-model object: its static bundle data plus the compiled runtime
# (`executable`) and the scheduling state (`sched`), which are both filled after construction
# (`executable` by the runtime once compiled, `sched` when the scheduler prepares the entry).
# The registry maps name -> entry and is the single source of truth for which models exist;
# the scheduler reads `entry.sched` rather than keeping a parallel map. Mutations to the map go
# through the scheduler's condition lock (see `admit!`/`evict!`).

# Collected when a bundle's model.jl calls register_model. The bundle loader sets up a
# fresh slot, includes model.jl, then reads the result back.
