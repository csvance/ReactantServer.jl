# The scheduler: a deficit-weighted, cost-aware, coalescing dispatch policy.
#
# Requests arrive concurrently and are placed in per-model queues. Whenever the GPU is free
# the scheduler decides which model to dispatch next, coalesces that model's queued requests
# into a single execution at a compiled batch size, runs it, and splits the outputs back to
# each caller. The policy layer rides on the language task scheduler; it does not implement
# its own threading. Only one execution runs at a time by design.
#
# Decision order each time the GPU frees up:
#   1. Score every model with a non-empty queue by a deficit-weighted, cost-aware
#      priority and pick the highest (or, under the FIFO discipline, pick the model
#      with the oldest queued request).
#   2. Coalesce the selected model's queued requests (FIFO) into one compiled-batch-size
#      dispatch; the remainder stays queued.
#
# Per-model latency budgets (earliest-deadline-first escalation) are a planned extension;
# they are not implemented.
#
# A single Threads.Condition guards all mutable scheduler state (the per-model queues and the
# EMA/cost fields) and signals the dispatch loop when work arrives. The loop holds the lock
# only to select and dequeue; the actual execution runs outside the lock so producers keep
# enqueuing during GPU work, then the lock is re-taken briefly to record the dispatch.

# Effective cost used for scoring when a (model, batch size) pair has no measurement yet. The
# absolute value does not matter: while every candidate is unseeded they share it, so the
# deficit term decides. Warmup normally seeds real values before traffic arrives.

Submit a request and block until the scheduler returns the result. Re-raises any error

dispatch loop: preprocess before the request is queued, postprocess on the raw device outputs the
loop hands back. Because each gRPC request runs on its own task, many requests' hook work
proceeds in parallel and overlaps the single, serialized GPU execution. The dispatch loop coalesces
and runs `qr.prepared` and never executes a request whose preprocess has not finished, since a
request is only enqueued (made visible to the loop) after preprocess returns.
