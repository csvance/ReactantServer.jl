# On-demand residency for unpinned model weights.
#
# Pinned models load their weights at startup and keep them on the device for the server's
# lifetime; they are exempt from the budget here. Every other model starts evicted and has
# its weights transferred to the device on first dispatch. Weights are kept resident after a
# dispatch (so back-to-back requests to the same model still coalesce) and evicted LRU only
# when a different model needs room and `max_bytes` would be exceeded.
#
# `max_bytes` budgets only the on-demand pool, i.e. the GPU memory left after the pinned
# models. It is sized by the operator with that in mind.
#
# Only the single dispatch-loop thread mutates the cache (plus startup, before that loop is
# spawned), so the read-decide-write of victim selection is internally consistent without a
# lock. The lock guards the brief bookkeeping commits against the read-only metrics snapshot;
# the slow device transfers run outside it.
