# The KServe V2 gRPC control plane. This is the only file that imports gRPCServer.

# gRPCServer hands each handler the already-decoded request message and serializes the
# message the handler returns, so the codec, scheduler, and runtime are untouched: the codec
# translates between wire messages and the boundary types, never touching framing. The system
# shared-memory extension RPCs register, unregister, and report client-provided regions, and
# RepositoryIndex lists the loaded models with per-model readiness (reflecting residency); the
# gateway calls it to autodiscover which workers currently serve each model.
