# Per-worker gRPC clients used to forward requests to the Julia inference workers. ModelInfer and
# the SHM RPCs use raw Vector{UInt8} clients so request and response bytes pass through without
# re-marshaling; ServerReady uses a typed client (the message is tiny). Clients are lightweight
# value structs over a shared libcurl multi handle, so one is built per worker and method up front
# and reused. The RegisterGate serializes ModelInfer against a worker while a SHM
# register/unregister to that worker is in flight (POSIX shm registration is host-global).

# Status strings surfaced to clients and recorded in metrics, mirroring the Go gateway.

# budget and request semaphore, isolating a slow or wedged worker to its own slots. The struct is
# parametric so every field keeps its concrete client type (the request path forwards through
# `infer` with no dynamic dispatch); the type parameters are inferred at construction.
