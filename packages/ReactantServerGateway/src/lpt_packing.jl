# LPT-packing scheduling: concentrate each model's traffic on few workers so the workers' batch
# coalescing has deep same-model queues to draw from, while balancing expected utilization across
# workers to avoid contention. Uniform spreading (round robin) is the worst case for coalescing
# when every model is loaded on every worker; concentration is the point of this mode.
#
# Each model is placed on a fixed, operator-configured number of distinct GPUs (`replicas`,
# default 1, never grown automatically under load). The packer chooses which GPUs by balancing two
# dimensions: expected compute utilization u_m = lambda_m * c_m (lambda_m the gateway-measured
# arrival rate EWMA, c_m the worker-reported per-request compute cost, both smoothed) and resident
# weight memory (ModelStatus.weight_nbytes) against each worker's weight-memory budget
# (ModelControlStatusResponse.weight_cache_max_bytes). The placement score is the max of the
# normalized compute and memory loads, so the packer simultaneously minimizes weight
# eviction/loading (memory pressure) and keeps every GPU busy (compute balance).
#
# Within a model's replica set the gateway routes each request to fill one replica's batch before
# moving to the next (see route_replica), using the worker-reported effective max batch size as the
# fill target, so the workers receive favorable groupings to coalesce. Coalescing itself stays at
# the worker; the gateway only routes and tracks a small per-replica outstanding counter.
#
# Repacks are driven by accumulated fleet compute, not wall-clock: the prober polls the workers
# every tick and a repack fires once the fleet has consumed `rebalance_compute_seconds`
# GPU-seconds since the last one, subject to a `min_rebalance_seconds` wall-clock floor.
#
# LPT-packing mode requires worker FIFO discipline and all models on all workers, verified as a hard
# failure at gateway startup (see verify_lpt_packing_preconditions!). Runtime drift degrades
# gracefully: a dead worker is excluded from placement until ready; a model temporarily missing
# from some workers gets a uniform distribution over its actual replicas with a warning.

# One model's placement: worker URLs with weights (1/k across its k replicas), sorted by URL.
# The weights are exported as metrics; request routing uses outstanding-batch counts, not weights.
const Placement = Vector{Tuple{String,Float64}}

# Watchdog ceiling for one control-status poll. The gateway's clients share one libcurl multi
# handle with a 16-slot request semaphore (GRPC_MAX_STREAMS); if its driving stalls, in-flight
# calls never release their slot and new calls block forever, so every poll is bounded and a worker
# that exceeds this is treated as not-polled.

    compute_assignment(u, workers, prev; mem=Dict(), mem_cap=Dict(),

        -> Dict{String,Placement}

Pure assignment math (no I/O): greedy two-dimensional (vector) bin packing onto a fixed number of
distinct GPUs per model. Every model demands compute time (`u[m]`, GPU-seconds/second) and resident
weight memory (`mem[m]`, bytes); every worker offers compute capacity 1.0 and a weight-memory
budget (`mem_cap[url]`, bytes; absent or `<= 0` means unconstrained, i.e. all weights resident).
Models are placed in descending compute-utilization order (memory-heavier first among ties), each
onto exactly `k = clamp(get(replicas, m, default_replicas), 1, length(workers))` distinct workers
chosen to minimize resulting pressure: the maximum of a worker's normalized compute and memory
loads. The max-norm balances the two competing concerns: a memory-full worker stops attracting
models even when compute-idle (avoiding eviction churn), and a compute-hot worker stops attracting
them even with memory free (avoiding idle GPUs).

A model's compute is charged `u[m]/k` to each of its `k` workers, its weights the full footprint
to every one (replication costs memory everywhere it serves). For `k == 1`, hysteresis keeps the
model's previous placement unless moving improves its resulting pressure by more than the threshold,
since placement stability is what coalescing buys from. For `k > 1`, the `k` lowest-pressure workers
are chosen, previous members winning ties for stability, and weights are even (`1/k`). Workers no
longer present are ignored in `prev`. Cold models (no traffic yet) carry `u[m] == 0` and are placed
like any other, packed by memory; models absent from `u` entirely are not placed and the caller
routes them uniformly. Load never changes a model's `k`; replica count is fixed by configuration.

    route_replica(s, model) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Vector{String}, Counters}}

Order a model's replicas for dispatch and reserve the chosen one. Returns `nothing` when the model
has no placement yet (cold or unknown); the caller falls back to round robin. Otherwise returns the
ordered replica URLs (the chosen worker first, the rest as failover) and `Counters`, the reserved
outstanding atomics to release when the request completes (`nothing` for a single-replica model,
which takes the fast path with no counter work). The chosen replica is the one that fills its batch
first: under the `fill` policy, the replica with the fewest full quanta of in-flight requests
(ties broken toward the replica closest to completing its current quantum, so one fills before the
next); under `least_outstanding`, the worker with the least total in-flight work. The reservation
(an atomic increment under the per-model selection lock) makes concurrent selections see the choice,
so requests do not stampede onto the same replica.

LPT-packing mode's startup checks: every configured worker must be reachable over the control
plane, report FIFO scheduling discipline, and serve an identical model set (load-all).

Reachability is gated rather than asserted: a worker compiles and warms up every model before its
control plane answers, so at startup the workers are usually not up yet. With `wait_seconds > 0`
(or `Inf` to wait indefinitely) the check polls every `poll_interval` seconds until all workers
answer, logging which are still pending; with `wait_seconds <= 0` (the default) it checks once and
fails fast. The supervisor sets this to wait for the workers it co-launches (see `gateway_spec`).
Once all workers are reachable, FIFO discipline and identical model sets are hard requirements and
a violation raises with the offending worker named.

Every poll is watchdog-bounded (`call_timeout`): the gateway's clients share one libcurl multi
handle whose request semaphore caps in-flight requests at GRPC_MAX_STREAMS (16). After the burst of
failed connects during warmup the handle's socket/timer driving can stall, so in-flight requests
never complete, never return their semaphore slot, and every new call blocks at acquire forever (the
"wedge"). A worker that is merely down refuses fast and releases its slot; but if every worker's
call exceeds the watchdog for `wedge_rounds` consecutive rounds (the wedge signature), the process
exits so the supervisor restarts the gateway with a fresh handle (16 free slots), which recovers.
